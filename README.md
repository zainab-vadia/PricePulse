# Inflation Insight Dashboard

### *Your personal window into Canada’s inflation trends*

This Streamlit web app visualizes grocery price trends using data parsed from a CSV file.  
It allows users to search for grocery items, explore historical price data, and access store links — all in a clean, modern interface.

- **Dynamic Charts:** Explore price trends over time with interactive Altair visualizations.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading**
   - Uses `ParseCsv()` from `main.py` to load and preprocess CSV data.  
   - Returns:
     - `raw_df`: Raw data with price history.
     - `consolidated_data`: Summary info for each item.

2. **Dashboard Flow**
   - Displays logo, search bar, and recommended cards.
   - Each card includes:
     - Image + Description  
     - “Details” button → shows price history  
     - “Shop Now” button → opens external link  

3. **Visualization**
   - Altair line chart of historical prices with min/max highlights.  
   - Interactive hover tooltips.

---

## Customization
You can modify constants at the top of `app.py`:
- **`NUMBER_OF_RECOMMENDATIONS`** → how many random cards show by default  
- **`ShopLinks`** → add or update store URLs  
- **Images/Logos** → replace files under `images/`  

To change theme or layout, edit the `CUSTOM_CARD_CSS` string.
